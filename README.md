To see my code: 
To be on the safe side I wrapped my entire project into a zip folder and uploaded it to gradescope. The file where my code is written is 
called gmt_attempt_2/lib/main.dart. The other relevant document (containing documentation) is called gmt_attempt_2/DESIGN.md. All of the other files 
were auto-generated or came with default flutter and ARE NOT written by me (not commented). The only reason I included them is for completeness and they 
are necessary if you want to test the application on your own device. 

To test my application on your own device:
I emailed both my TA and the heads of CS50 and we all agreed that there is no easy way to run this code on a device that doesn't have 
Android Studio. As such, it was suggested that the application is graded based on the video and (if necessary) a live demonstration. 
If you want to download Android Studio and test the code for yourself, please follow these steps. 

1.) Download Android Studio (https://developer.android.com/studio)
2.) Download an android emulator on Android Studio (click on "AVD MANAGER" in top left corner and then "Create new virtual device"). 
3.) Access my code from github (if you are my TA it is already shared with you)
4.) Follow these 5 steps from a youtube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ey3pZt9Afs)
